This series is designed to help you think critically, but it is not meant to be laborious and tiresome. When you see a comment with a green checkmark like this, it will usually let you know about a location you can skip to. For instance, if you already have **Bash** and **git** installed on your computer and feel relatively comfortable with them, you can skip to the [git setup](version_control/git-setup.md) section.
