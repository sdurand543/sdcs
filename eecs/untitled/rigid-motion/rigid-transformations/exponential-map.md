# Exponential Map

## Intro

Before we get into rigid transformations, we will discuss a notational / functional tool that will help us convert from matrix derivatives to their integrated displacements. This is helpful for rigid transformations, which are easier to define using their derivatives.

## Exponential Map

$$exp : \mathbb{R^n} \rightarrow \mathbb{R^n}$$

$$
e^{x} = I + x + \frac{x^2}{2!} + \frac{x^3}{3!} + \dots
$$
