# Software Development Process

## Plan and Develop

As the name implies, the P&D software development approach involves distinct planning and development phases, along with extensive documentation.

Here are the three main categories of P&D software development processes.

1. Waterfall
2. Spiral
3. Rational Unified Process \(RUP\)

### Waterfall

Waterfall consists of 5 unidirectional stages.

1. Requirements: determine what it is you need to accomplish
2. Design: determine how you will accomplish it
3. Implementation: code the design
4. Verification: test that the requirements were met
5. Maintenance: maintain and update the codebase to meet customer needs

Waterfall is iterative in a way that catches bugs earlier \(not just coding bugs, but requirements bugs, design bugs, etc\).

However, Waterfall is particularly bad at adapting to evolving customer requirements later on in the process.

### Spiral

Spiral consists of 4 cyclic stages.

1. Objectives and Constraints: determine what you want to accomplish and its complexity
2. Evaluate Alternatives: identify and resolve risks
3. Prototype: produce the prototype for this iteration
4. Approval: communicate with stakeholders and plan the next iteration

Spiral has several advantages. Spiral development is risk averse and are good at meeting flexible / evolving requirements.

However, Spiral development is expensive and scales down poorly \(unsuitable for small projects\). Its flexible number of iterations can be seen as a disadvantage in terms of time management / scheduling.

### Rational Unified Process

Rational Unified Process \(RUP\) involves 4 dynamic phases.

1. Inception: business case, schedule, and budget
2. Elaboration: identify use cases, software architecture, set a development plan, and prototype
3. Construction: code and develop the product in a releasable form
4. Transition: production, customer acceptance testing, and user training

Each phase involves many iterations.

## Agile

The Agile development process is focused on meeting fluid customer demands. Some guiding principles include:

1. Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
2. Working software over comprehensive documentation
3. Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
4. Respond to change over sicking to a plan

Because customer acceptance testing is fused as part of the development process, the Agile development process is particularly good at reacting to evolving customer needs, without the expensive infrastructure of the Waterfall approach.
