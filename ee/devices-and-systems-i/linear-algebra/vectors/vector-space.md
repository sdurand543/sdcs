# Vector Space

## Vector Space

Informally, a vector space is a set of vectors that you cannot 'leave' using linear combinations of participating vectors.

> Somewhat formally, a vector space is a set of vectors that satisfies the following axioms:

> 1. Associative in Vector-Vector Addition
> 2. Commutative in Vector-Vector Addition
> 3. Compatibility of Vector-Scalar Multiplication
> 4. Additive and Multiplicative Identities
> 5. Additive Vector-Vector Inverse \(Vector Negation\)
> 6. Distributive in Vector-Vector and Vector-Scalar Multiplication
> 7. Closure under Vector-Vector Addition and Vector-Scalar Multiplication
